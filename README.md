# Predict Trip Cost
Data science project to predict taxi trip costs using regression models, feature selection and feature engineering.

This repository contains a regression data science project. The objective is to analyze a trip database to build a model capable of predicting the cost of a trip.

The project encompasses Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature extraction, and the construction of a Machine Learning model to predict trip costs.
